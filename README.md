## NFT Ecosystem ❤️

The Algorand is an open-source proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. It boasts a highly-efficient, scalable platform that can achieve transaction instant finality. Furthermore, Algorand strives to become the most efficient and greenest blockchain. Since April 2021, Algorand has achieved carbon negativity by purchasing carbon credits that exceed its carbon emissions.

Due to Algorand’s extraordinary performance, more and more teams are choosing to build their projects on it, with no exception NFT Project. At first glance, Algorand has gathered some basic NFT pieces for its ecosystem, such as NFT Explorer, NFT Ranking tool, GameFi and Marketplace. However, NFT on Algorand is currently in the early stages of development, meaning that they don’t have any outstanding performance. NFT on Algorand have to grow more maturely in order for the whole ecosystem to thrive. Algorand needs to bring more traffic towards the marketplace, attract more artists, increase social media awareness & building up some ‘hype’.

Applying the right NFT Marketing Strategy is essential to growing the whole ecosystem. The NFT market has become competitive as many blockchain networks have joined the bandwagon. Furthermore, crowds are becoming more informed and choosy at the same time. Thus, NFT on Algorand only catches the attention of the creator, collector or developer if Algorand uses a top-notch NFT marketing strategy. Here, I delve into the best NFT marketing strategy that Algorand can use to boost the growth of NFT on Algorand.
